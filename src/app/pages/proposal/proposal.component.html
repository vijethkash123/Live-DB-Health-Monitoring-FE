    <h3 style="color:#367fa9"> Proposal</h3>
    <br>
    <h4 style="color:#367fa9"> Summary</h4>
    <p>To prepare and present a winning Project proposal to the client that will become the basis for contract negotiations. The proposal's purpose is to maximize the chances of obtaining the client's business, while defining the business solution and BRILLIO's terms and conditions.</p>
    <h4 style="color:#367fa9"> Objective </h4>
    <p>To prepare and present a winning Project proposal to the client that will become the basis for contract negotiations. The proposal's purpose is to maximize the chances of obtaining the client's business, while defining the business solution and BRILLIO's terms and conditions.</p>
    <h4 style="color:#367fa9">Description</h4>
    <p>The proposal, when well prepared and professionally packaged, becomes a powerful sales tool used to obtain new business and revenue for BRILLIO. Its purpose is to maximize the chances of obtaining the client's business, while outlining the business solution and relationship that BRILLIO has to offer.</p>
    <p>In all situations, BRILLIO's decision to prepare a proposal is reached after examining the opportunity with respect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pre-sales activities, e.g. marketing, selling and opportunity shaping; </li>
      <li>	Knowledge of the client, e.g. needs, business, organization, financial health, budget and environment; </li>
      <li>	Sales opportunity, i.e. potential benefits to BRILLIO; </li>
      <li>	Detailed requirements as stated in the RFP; </li>
      <li>	Competition, i.e. knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of the competition as well as BRILLIO in the marketplace; </li>
      <li>	Resources, i.e. availability to pursue the opportunity; </li>
      <li>	Risk, i.e. initial identification and assessment of uncertainties that may be associated with the client's requirements or circumstances.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Within a full or partial outsourcing services engagement, change requests may result in a project being initiated once approved by the client. When a new contract is required, we should follow the project engagement rules as defined in this Proposal and the following Contract phases. Should the initial outsourcing contract include an "umbrella" clause to cover future projects, the rules for such projects are much simpler, as the majority of the terms and conditions would have already been defined. In this case, please refer to the "Manage Projects" activity of the Outsourcing Services Delivery Phase for the appropriate process flow.</p>
 <ul>
<li>	business process re-engineering, e.g. business functions and process optimization and change; </li>
<li>	IT infrastructures design and implementation, e.g. workstation/server, mainframe or network architectures; </li>
<li>development of new systems, functions, interfaces and business processes; </li>
<li>system conversion; </li>
<li>documentation and training. </li>
</ul>
<p>
The activities performed in this phase will permit BRILLIO to present the best possible competitive and well prepared proposal, using the most accurate information from the client's current IS/IT and business environments.
</p>
<p>
Proposal activities may be "iterative" and may involve several revisions and discussions with the client, business and technical subject matter experts, teaming partners and BRILLIO managers with specific client intelligence before a finalized proposal is completed.
</p>
<p>
When involving senior and executive management as well as review and Engagement Assessment Services groups, it is important to plan for availability, and transfer supporting information to these individuals as soon as possible. A rule of thumb often used is to contact the individuals involved as soon as the proposal work plan is completed. Plan to send the available information to them at 25% completion of your proposal preparation work. Plan for final review and sign-off at the 80% completion mark. This will enable you to complete the necessary changes to your proposal without delaying your proposal delivery deadline.

      <h4 style="color:#367fa9">Description</h4>
      <p>This activity and associated sub-activities are required to organize and plan for what lies ahead in the Proposal phase. Preparation and organization are very important in order to present the client with a well prepared and packaged proposal.</p>
      <p>A detailed analysis and review of the request for proposal (RFP), if available, or information and documentation provided by the client or other sources is also important and should be performed. Valuable information about the client's IS/IT organization, needs, objectives and requirements are gathered from the documents and resulting analysis. It is during this analysis that risks and impacts are identified and evaluated to determine the viability of pursuing this project opportunity.</p>
      <p>Once completed, you should define your winning proposal strategy, identify the plan and resources and track the timelines needed to reach the milestones within the time constraints or duration outlined by the RFP or "unsolicited" bid. The complexity of the work plan is dependent on the size and scope of the opportunity being pursued.</p>
      <p>Team briefings, multiple work and synergy sessions can be used to keep the individuals, both inside and outside the proposal team, well informed on the progress of this phase and key issues to be resolved.</p>
      <p>The Win Probability Matrix should be updated at the end of this activity to review BRILLIO's position and determine the chances of wining this Project engagement.</p>

      <p>To document BRILLIO's ability to deliver the best approach to the client in the most cost effective manner in order to win the business.</p>
      <h4 style="color:#367fa9">Description</h4>
      <p>The proposal, both a technical document and sales presentation, is an influential product that reflects the preparation efforts of the team assigned to win the business. The document will be read and judged by technical evaluators, contract and legal management, financial management and executives. As such, the proposal needs to demonstrate that BRILLIO understands the client's organization and that BRILLIO has the ability to meet the client's objectives.</p>
      <p>The complexity and degree of detail in the proposal document or presentation can vary, depending on the type of Project engagement being pursued. Large system integration project proposals may represent several volumes and address multiple facets of a client's needs and requirements.</p>
      <p>Key activities in the preparation of the proposal include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Compiling and verifying the scope of the approach to be delivered (both explicit and implicit), based on all sources of information, including assumptions (such as the client's views on use of open source software) and prior client knowledge (from BRILLIO members or teaming partners); </li>
      <li>Preparing the proposal table of contents or outline;  </li>
      <li>Preparing the proposal format (this may be specified by the RFP); </li>
      <li>Analyzing and designing a competitive solution that will meet all of the client's needs and requirements, including client preferences on the use of open source software for system development projects; </li>
      <li>Developing and articulating the key messages that characterize BRILLIO's approach and solution; </li>
      <li>Booking review dates with BRILLIO management for the proposal review and approval;  </li>
      <li>Planning and costing all elements of the proposed solution</li>
      <li>Writing all chapters of the proposal, including an executive overview or summary (a proposal presentation may also be prepared, particularly in "unsolicited" bids); </li>
      <li>Packaging all documentation and supporting materials; </li>
      <li>Reviewing the proposal at various stages to ensure it complies with all of the client's requirements, keeping the client's evaluation criteria in mind. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Project proposals, given their varying complexity and level of detail, require a thorough analysis of all available client information. They also involve the review of the contractual environment that will surround our project delivery. The following areas reflect only a small sample:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Business solutions currently in practice and planned; </li>
      <li>Systems operation, i.e. mainframe, mid-range systems, networks, workstations; </li>
      <li>Technical architectures, e.g. multi-vendor, multi-system, integrated, standalone, potential use of open source software; </li>
      <li>Best practices currently in use and planned; </li>
      <li>Financial incentives, liabilities or penalties; </li>
      <li>External or internal contractual arrangements and obligations; </li>
      <li>Alliances, partnerships, relationships (internal, or external); </li>
      <li>Licenses, copyrights, patents, trademarks or identity branding; </li>
      <li>Security considerations, such as the requirement for the client to adhere to BRILLIO's security policies if using any BRILLIO assets. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The proposal is a legally binding document that will be used to form the basis of contract negotiations that BRILLIO and the client will enter. The proposal needs to include terms and conditions regarding the limitation of liability and the statement that no transaction will occur between BRILLIO and the client unless the parties execute an agreement (to avoid the possibility of the client accepting the proposal without any further negotiations). Finally, remember to include risk mitigation strategies for those risks identified in the initial risk assessment. Elements of risk should always be taken into account when assessing the proposal.</p>
      <p>During the proposal preparation, quick, daily situation review meetings are suggested to maintain momentum and circulate available information to all team members. These sessions should be used to focus team members on their tasks and ensure all relevant information is made known and available. Ensuring the team understands the information and requirements will assist with the proposal development</p>
      <p>It is the responsibility of each team member to identify (as early as possible) activities or deliverables that cannot be completed in the time allocated so that appropriate action and resolution can take place. Such resolution may involve additional resources or information being made available.</p>
      <p>When involvement from any of the following: senior or executive management, review or Engagement Assessment Services group, is necessary for the proposal, it is important to plan for availability and transfer supporting information to these individuals as soon as possible. Plan to send the available information to them at 25% completion of your proposal preparation work. Plan for final review and sign-off at the 80% completion mark. This will enable you to complete the necessary changes to your proposal without delaying your presentation deadline.</p>
      <p>While building the proposal, all meeting agendas, minutes and notes should be kept in order to build the knowledge repository for this and future phases.</p>

<h4 style="color:#367fa9">Description</h4>
<p>During the initial analysis of the RFP or client information, it is important to assess BRILLIO's ability to provide the best approach, either internally or through strategic alliances with external suppliers or teaming partners. Additional suppliers may be required to answer specific service requirements outlined by the RFP or client information or to mitigate some of the risk.</p>
<p>Such alliances and relationships may be borne out of necessity if BRILLIO does not have the ability to provide the services, or BRILLIO may choose to enter into such agreements. These agreements may provide a more cost-effective alternative to deliver the services, resolve a specific weakness in BRILLIO, mitigate identified risks, or enhance our chances of winning the client's business</p>
<p>A teaming agreement may also result when both parties agree to work together during the submission of a proposal, identifying one of the parties as prime and the other as a subcontractor. Such agreements should cover the period during the proposal and contract negotiations with the client and should describe the proposed relationship once the BRILLIO and client contract has been granted.</p>
<p>Teaming partners are assessed and selected based on their ability to meet service delivery requirements. Such partners will provide service or delivery directly through BRILLIO, and their services may include areas such as design, development, hardware, software, network, documentation, training, quality assurance or other specialities. It is important to negotiate such teaming agreements as soon as possible, because the best teaming partners are often in demand.</p>
<p>Any teaming agreement must specify:</p>
<ul>
<li>Roles and responsibilities of each party; </li>
<li>Scope of work to be performed by the supplier or subcontractor;   </li>
<li>Degree of exclusivity between BRILLIO and the supplier or subcontractor; </li>
<li>Principal terms and conditions that will apply to any resulting work (per diem, fixed price, flow through of terms from prime contract); </li>

<li>Deliverable due dates and submission of a final quotation prior to BRILLIO's costing and pricing exercise. </li>
</ul>
<p>When in proposal discussions, particularly for large project bids, a non-disclosure agreement between BRILLIO and the teaming partners may be required to protect intellectual property and competitive information that may be shared during sensitive discussions. Consideration should be given to such non-disclosure agreements, and appropriate documents and signatures should be obtained.</p>

      <h4 style="color:#367fa9"> Objective</h4>
      <p>To establish the costing, pricing and supporting documentation, based on the RFP, information provided by the client and other sources, to be included in the Project proposal.</p>
      <h4 style="color:#367fa9">Description</h4>
      <p>During analysis of the RFP (if available), client-provided documentation or assumptions made concerning the BRILLIO bid, appropriate costing estimates and BRILLIO pricing need to be determined. These costs include the goods, services, contracts, investments and staff required to set up and deliver the project.</p>
      <p>Vigilant care must be taken during this activity to ensure all costs associated with this opportunity are identified and assessed and that the pricing of this Project engagement is in line with BRILLIO's corporate objectives.</p>
      <p>All relevant information, risks and assumptions should be analyzed, assessed and validated by the proposal team in order to clarify, quantify and develop BRILLIO's costing of this opportunity. The strategies and work plans used within this phase should provide the necessary input to validate the overall cost estimates.</p>
      <p>As early as possible, costs and associated pricing for strategic alliances, external suppliers or subcontractors involved in any portion of the project or proposal submission need to be identified for analysis and included in the overall proposal costs. Reviewing cost and price elements with other BRILLIO members assures the quality of the information before the submission of the end result to BRILLIO senior management.</p>
      <p>Although influenced by the scope, risks and strategic aspects of the project, the following steps can be followed to establish the project effort, cost, price and financial information:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Define Scope and Work Breakdown Structure 
      <ul>
      <li>Define scope, deliverables, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), mapping the WBS back to scope and deliverables. </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Establish Costing
      <ul>
      <li>Estimate effort of WBS (generate list of budget assumptions, questions) using two estimation methods; </li>
      <li>Determine cost of efforts, expenses, materials; </li>
      <li>Finalize cost, including risk factors. </li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Establish Pricing
      <ul>
      <li>Determine overall price, adding profit margin; </li>
      <li>Backtrack mapping of price to client-required price breakdown; </li>
      <li>Prepare cash flow analysis for entire project duration; </li>
      <li>Identify negative cash flow areas; </li>
      <li>Identify financing issues. </li>
      </ul>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Large system integration projects may involve multi-year contracts and will need to be costed and priced according to long-term financial models. Initial assumptions surrounding costing, pricing and potential cost to be passed to the client need to be forecasted for the duration of the potential contract. Adjustments are made based on information that becomes available throughout the Proposal activities.</p>
      <p>BRILLIO's efforts, assumptions and findings will need to be broken down into their cost components for analysis and assessment. This assessment should provide a clear and overall understanding of the financial viability for this engagement and assist BRILLIO in determining if this project opportunity should be pursued.</p>
      <p>This is done by examining the following, which reflects only a small sample:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Project set-up costs; </li>
      <li>Delivery requirements as specified in the RFP or client-provided documentation, including requirements related to the security of any data made available to BRILLIO; </li>
      <li>Assets, e.g. hardware, software, applications, network, real estate, and any security requirements associated with these assets; </li>
      <li>Financing of the purchase, i.e. dollar value and the costs of obtaining this funding; </li>
      <li>Deposition charges, should BRILLIO not purchase assets; </li>
      <li>Human resources, e.g. salaries, benefits and obligations, based on a determination of the knowledge and skills needed to produce the proposed solution; </li>
      <li>External contractual obligations and penalties for early termination; </li>

      <li>Supplier or subcontractor costs involved with BRILLIO for service delivery. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This information will take time to gather from various sources, so it is important to keep team members and senior management well informed as financial information becomes available, as per Operations Management Framework (OMF) guidelines. This is especially important for large system integration or development projects, where significant financial impacts to BRILLIO could result. For all reviews involving Engagement Assessment Services, two project estimates prepared by knowledgeable experts will be required to assess the quality of the work plan.</p>
      <p>A financial analysis summary will be produced. This summary will be presented to BRILLIO senior management for their review and included (either partially or totally) in the project proposal.</p>

      <h4 style="color:#367fa9"> Objective</h4>
      <p>To examine and fine-tune the proposal, ensuring the final product meets the client's objectives.</p>
      <h4 style="color:#367fa9">Description</h4>
      <p>Proposal reviews are performed throughout the proposal process, and final adjustments are made as needed. Checks are required to ensure the client's needs and requirements are addressed and the proposal conforms to requirements as specified in the RFP. Similar checks and adjustments are made for "unsolicited" proposals as well.</p>
      <p>Meetings with BRILLIO senior management, contractual, legal and financial teams, as per the Operations Management Framework, need to take place for review and approval prior to obtaining their sign-off. This is especially important for large system integration and development project bids, where significant implications to BRILLIO may result. Keeping these groups informed throughout the proposal process will aid in obtaining their approval.</p>
      <p>The proposal is scrutinized by examining the following:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Structure, approach and financial models used; </li>
      <li>Content, i.e. does it meet the RFP or "unsolicited" bid requirements; </li>
      <li>Persuasiveness, i.e. does it convey the message and solicit a client approval; </li>
      <li>Professionalism, e.g. packaging and presentation of materials; </li>
      <li>Consistency, e.g. wording, marketing, commitments; </li>
      <li>Degree to which all supporting documentation is complete; </li>
      <li>Feasibility of the proposed approach, including the appropriate use of open source software if it is being proposed; </li>
      <li>Availability of the key resources;</li>
      <li>Costing and pricing of the project bid, including assumptions; </li>
      <li>Realism of the estimates; </li>
      <li>Financial and legal implications of obtaining this project; </li>
      <li>Overall project work plan; </li>
      <li>Strategic alliances and contractual arrangements; </li>
      <li>Contractual terms and conditions; </li>
      <li>Presentation of BRILLIO's value-add position. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Ensure the objectives of the proposal match the philosophy and the needs of the client, such as when open source software is being proposed. The consequences of elements and attributes in the proposal are not always modifiable during future negotiations.</p>
      <p>When involvement from senior and executive management as well as review and Engagement Assessment Services groups is necessary for the proposal, it is important to plan for availability and transfer supporting information to these individuals as soon as possible. Plan for final review and sign-off at the 80% completion mark. This will enable you to complete the necessary changes to your proposal without delaying your presentation deadline.</p>
      <p>All meeting agendas, minutes and notes should be kept in order to build the knowledge repository for this and future phases.</p>

      <h4 style="color:#367fa9"> Objective</h4>
      <p>To obtain BRILLIO senior management approval and sign-off, primarily on the financial aspects of the Project proposal.</p>
      <h4 style="color:#367fa9">Description</h4>
      <p>The proposal is a legally binding agreement that will be used to form the basis for contract negotiations between BRILLIO and the client. The proposal also provides a basis for the final contract that BRILLIO must successfully deliver, should BRILLIO win the business</p>
      <p>It is important to prepare a summary or presentation for BRILLIO senior management review, which would include the proposal strategy, financial models, and anticipated results of this Project bid.</p>
      <p>Sufficient time must be allowed in the proposal preparation and work plan for review and approval of the entire proposal package and supporting material. The level of authorization and sign-off is specified by the Operations Management Framework (OMF) and is based on the overall value of the anticipated Project opportunity.</p>
      <p>Senior management approval, based on the OMF, is especially important for large system integration and development project bids, where significant implications to BRILLIO may result. Keeping senior management informed throughout the proposal process will aid in obtaining their authorization and sign-off. For these large value proposals, an early preliminary review with the signing authorities is advised to review overall strategy, costing and pricing.</p>
      <p>The proposal cannot be delivered to the client until the required approvals and sign-off have been provided. Plan for final review and sign-off at the 80% completion mark. This will enable you to complete the necessary changes to your proposal without delaying your presentation deadline.</p>

      <p>To deliver and optionally present the finalized Project proposal to the client.</p>
      <h4 style="color:#367fa9">Description</h4>
      <p>A finalized proposal, possibly combined with supportive material, is delivered and optionally presented to the client. This activity may involve several presentations providing various levels of detail to the client's senior management and key members of their organization. Sufficient copies of the proposal and associated material will need to be made available to each person attending such presentations.</p>
      <p>In an "unsolicited" bid situation, discussions and presentations may start off gradually and informally, initially with discussions of the client's needs, the merits of a project proposal and approaches that BRILLIO could offer. Subsequent discussions may evolve into the development and submission of one or more proposals and formal presentations to the client.</p>
      <p>The request for proposal (RFP) bid situation is more formal and structured, as BRILLIO is being asked to deliver a proposal to meet the specific objectives of the client. The RFP may specify proposal and presentation formats as well as identify time constraints for the delivery of proposal material. Further discussions and contract negotiation activities may result, if successful.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the situation, reaching this stage to present a proposal may have required significant investment in time and resources from BRILLIO.</p>
      <p>Based on a successful proposal delivery and presentation, BRILLIO and the client may agree to move forward to the next phase, contract negotiations.</p>

      <p>To review and monitor the client's responses to BRILLIO's Project proposal and make required adjustments until the client communicates a final decision to BRILLIO.</p>
      <h4 style="color:#367fa9">Description</h4>
      <p>After the proposal has been presented to the client, continued adjustments and marketing may be required to meet the client's objectives. Such adjustments may include clarifications, additional presentations and revisions in order to come to an agreement.</p>
      <p>As stated earlier, the proposal process is an "iterative" process that may continue for some time until a formal and final client decision is communicated to BRILLIO. Various business pressures may often delay a final decision, and in some cases we may be asked to revise (either totally or partially) and re-submit our proposal. Any changes to costs need to be carefully reviewed and any increase in risk documented and approved.</p>
      <p>In the event that revisions are made to the initial proposal, approval from the original signing authorities, as per Operations Management Framework (OMF), is required for any material changes, as are any clarifications that could have an impact on BRILLIO's ability to deliver the project and on the timeframes originally outlined.</p>
      <p>Because of the amount of effort that is normally involved to reach this point, it is important that all the information gathered or produced for this client be kept on file and made available at any time. This will permit the information to be available for review at any point during the future Contract phase.</p>
      <p>Should BRILLIO not win this client's project business, the causes or reasons (if available) should be noted and communicated to sales and filed, so that future bids for this client and others are more successful.</p>
