        <h4 style="color:#367fa9"> Objective</h4>
        <p> To establish the management environment in which the project will be executed.</p>
        <h4 style="color:#367fa9">Description</h4>
        <p>Performing the Start-up-activity is essential to clearly establishing how the project will be set-up and
          therefore facilitates the project's execution and control activities. It also facilitates communication and
          relationships that must be established with the project stakeholders throughout the project's execution.</p>
        <p>In all projects where BRILLIO is responsible in whole or in part for the outcome, the project Start-up
          activity
          and particularly the preparation of the Project Plan are highly recommended. In working environments where
          business and project management processes are already documented (e.g. BRILLIO business units and outsourcing
          services engagements including project management processes), only the key and specific elements of the
          Project
          Plan (e.g. project definition, scope, assumptions, organizational structure and work plan) need to be
          documented. Project scope, size, complexity, risk, strategic value and BRILLIO management requirements should
          guide the decision to prepare a Project Plan.</p>
        <p>If the project is using open source software, review the Open Source Checklist as a reminder of management
          activities related to open source software usage during the Delivery phase.</p>
        <p>The Start-up activity can be performed in the following situations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For project delivery to a client; </li>
          <li>For BRILLIO's internal projects; </li>
          <li>For the execution of some phases of the Client Partnership Management Framework, such as the preparation
            of
            a proposal, due diligence and transition. These phases are considered and conducted as projects; </li>
          <li>For a project that is derived from an Outsourcing Services engagement, the project can be part of the
            contract (e.g. part of the contract schedules or part of an annual work program, open delivery budget), or
            can
            arise in the course of the engagement evolution. </li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Start-up activity consists of the following sub-activities:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Confirm the project work environnement within which will work the project team and will have an implact on
            the work methods; </li>
          <li>Preparing the Project Plan, describing the scope, assumptions, management organizational structure,
            management processes and work plan; </li>
          <li>Reviewing the document to verify its compliance with previous phases requirements and project management
            guidelines and obtaining approvals; </li>
          <li>Confirming the assignment of project team members. </li>
          <li></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The "Legal Framework for Proposals and Contracts" mentioned in the "References" section will assist you in
          reviewing the essential clauses of the agreements that are usually signed by BRILLIO. If you need
          clarification
          or a better understanding of any particular clause, do not hesitate to contact our in-house legal counsel.</p>

      <h4 style="color:#367fa9"> Objective</h4>
      <p>To conduct the project and control its execution by applying the project management processes defined in the
        Project Plan.</p>
      <h4 style="color:#367fa9">Description</h4>
      <p>Following the project planning processes of the Start-up Project activity, this activity covers the management
        of the actual delivery of the project's outcome: its deliverables. To effectively manage a project, the
        following steps should be applied according to the defined processes of the project plan:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Track deliverables and manage their procurement, team efforts, costs and expenses: track the execution of
          the project's activities, subcontracted deliverables and their impact on the Project Work Plan and the project
          budget; </li>
        <li>Manage risks: track and mitigate the project's risks; </li>
        <li>Control assignments: control the assignment and de-assignment of project team members; </li>
        <li>Process project change requests: evaluate the impacts of project change requests, process their approvals
          and integrate them into the overall project plan; </li>
        <li>Resolve outstanding issues: identify, track and resolve outstanding issues; </li>
        <li>Verify deliverable compliance: validate and verify project deliverables against established criteria and
          requirements and process their approvals; </li>
        <li>intain project configuration item list: maintain the project list of deliverables and their status; </li>
        <li>Report to client authority and BRILLIO management: report information on the project's status, as part of
          communication management processes; </li>
        <li>Perform milestone reviews and focus synergy sessions: conduct the reviews and synergy sessions according to
          Project Plan or as needed; </li>
        <li>Manage human resources: integrate and support project team members; </li>
        <li>Perform team members' performance appraisals: perform individual performance appraisals as required. </li>

      </ul>
      <p>Although the extent of the application of each of these management activities should be guided by the project
        scope, size, complexity, risk, strategic value and BRILLIO management requirements, applying these processes
        will ensure proper control over the project's execution, particularly in the area of scope management.
        Ineffective scope management is recognized as one of the major causes for project failure.</p>
      <p>These processes are iterative and will be repeated several times throughout the project (e.g. tracking
        deliverables, milestone reviews, maintaining the configuration item list). They should also be recognized as an
        integrated group of processes. For example, an outstanding issue can be resolved by a project change request.
        This request will be recorded in the Change Request List and the associated deliverables version changes in the
        Configuration Item List. It should be noted that the order in which they are described is not an indication of
        the order in which they are actually performed.</p>
      <p>These processes support the monitoring of the project's performance, which should be reported regularly to the
        project management authorities to identify variance from the initial plan. This can help management in taking
        preventive actions in anticipation of possible problems.</p>
      <p>In order to ensure proper understanding of the project's management environment and outcome by all project
        stakeholders, the Execute and Control Project activity should not start before the Project Plan has been
        approved (see Start-up Project, Review and Approve Project Plan).</p>
      <p>All documents produced (including notes, meeting minutes) and forms completed and signed during the application
        of the project delivery management processes should be retained in a Project File. This project file represents
        the repository of project management information that will, at the end of the project, be archived for future
        reference.</p>
